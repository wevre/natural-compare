:section Introduction

	A comparator for natural sorting of strings. Embedded digits are compared as
	integers. Inspired by Wilker Lúcio's {`natural-sort.clj` gist}[wilkerlucio].

:section How to use

	When comparing strings, use natural-compare as the comparator.

	``` deps.edn
		{...
		 :deps {...
		        wevre/natural-compare {:git/url ""
		                               :sha ""}
		        ...}
		 ...}

	``` your-namespace.clj
		(ns your-namespace
		  (:require [wevre.natural-compare :refer [natural-compare]]))

		(def ss ["t3" "t1" "t10" "t12" "t2" "t27"])

		(sort natural-compare arr)

		;; => ("t1" "t2" "t3" "t10" "t12" "t27")

:section How it works

	`natural-compare` compares two strings. Each is split into a sequence of
	alternating text and integer elements and then the two sequences are compared
	element by element. The trick is to make sure that when splitting the string,
	the first element is always text, the elements always alternate between text
	and integer, and the last element is an integer. The sequence is padded as
	necessary with values "" and -1 (which always sort lower than 'legit' values)
	to make sure shorter strings sort first.

	See test cases for examples of splitting.

:section Learnings

	* Test files need to be `.clj` for test-runner to find them.

	* Reader conditionals only work in `.cljc` files.

	* POM file needs a <resources> section under the <build> section in order to
	include the .clj files in the output JAR file.
